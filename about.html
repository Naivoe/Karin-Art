    <h3>Free-your-mind</h3>

     <p>My name is Karin and I live in a city close to Amsterdam, in the northern part of The Netherlands.
      I flew over 35 years as a flight attendant for KLM. However, now I am a pensionada, this naturely comes with free time.<br>
      
      
      <br>All paintings are made by myself.
      Each painting reflects a feeling, a phase of life or simply a moment at that time. <br>
      
      
     <br> I see myself as an free artist and I like to do everything in my own way. I do not want to go to classes, because who determines what you want to paint and which brush you'll have to use?
      As a free painter I determine myself. <br>
     <br> I love colours and use them in every way <br>
      
      
     <br> I hope you like my paintings.
      If you're interested in one or more of my paintings, please go to the contact page and send me an E-mail.
